    <p>To verify a document you need one of our &quot;signature bundles&quot;. You can
        click the <em>Use above signature</em> button to use the signature bundle you
        just created or you can paste the JSON of
        a previously saved signature bundle into the <em>Signature bundle</em> text
        area. If you use the later option click the <em>Process JSON</em> button.</p>
    <p>Now you can see if the signature is valid, i.e., that is verifies by
        clicking the <em>Verify Signature</em> button.</p>
    <p>But wait, there's more... You can try modifying the signature bundle by
        clicking the little triangle next to <em>Modify Signature Bundle</em>. You
        can make tiny or large changes to any of the content of the signature bundle
        and see that <strong>any</strong> change will result in the signature <strong>not</strong> verifying.</p>
