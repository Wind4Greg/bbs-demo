To sign documents you need to have a private key. For our BBS signatures 
this key **must** be 64 hexadecimal characters (0-9, a, b, c, d, e, or, f). You
can click the *Generate Random Key* button and we will generate an appropriate key for you
or you can enter exactly 64 hexadecimal characters.

After you have entered a valid private key we will show you its value as a very large
integer in the *Private Key as Scalar* field. In addition we will show you the corresponding
*Public Key in Hex*.

The private key is used during document signing and the public key is included in our
"signature bundle" to enable verification of the signature.
