To verify a document you need one of our "signature bundles". You can
click the *Use above signature* button to use the signature bundle you
just created or you can paste the JSON of
a previously saved signature bundle into the *Signature bundle* text
area. If you use the later option click the *Process JSON* button.

Now you can see if the signature is valid, i.e., that is verifies by
clicking the *Verify Signature* button.

But wait, there's more... You can try modifying the signature bundle by
clicking the little triangle next to *Modify Signature Bundle*. You
can make tiny or large changes to any of the content of the signature bundle
and see that **any** change will result in the signature **not** verifying.
